Hi, I'm *Hafsa Majeed*, a BS English student currently in my 7th semester. I belong to *Lodhran city*, and along with my academic background in English, I have a growing passion for *cybersecurity*.

We live in a digital age where cyber attacks have become more frequent and dangerous. I want to play my role in *protecting organizations and my country* from these threats. This passion led me to complete a *cybersecurity course on Coursera*, where I gained valuable knowledge and skills.

During the course, I learned about core cybersecurity concepts like the *CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)*, and studied major cyber attacks in history, such as the *ILOVEYOU virus* and the *Morris Worm*. I also explored essential tools and technologies including *SQL*, *Python*, and the *Linux operating system*, which is widely used in cybersecurity environments.

My journey in cybersecurity has just begun, and I'm excited to continue learning and contributing to a safer digital world.
This journey marks the beginning of my path in cybersecurity, and I am eager to continue learning and contributing to building a more secure digital future.
